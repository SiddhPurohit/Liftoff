My capstone project

To run this project you will have add your OpenAi api key in chat.dart file.

Do not forget to run Pub get

Also you will need to reconfigure the app on your Firebase project for the otp login to work

I also recommend using your own api key for google maps in the AndroidManifest.xml file.



Using the api link you will only have 15 api calls per hour, for testing and developing purpose you should let it be in dev mode before you deploy.
