My capstone project

To run this project you will have to add your OpenAi api key in chat.dart file.

Do not forget to run Pub get

Also you will need to reconfigure the app on your Firebase project for the otp login to work

I also recommend using your own api key for google maps in the AndroidManifest.xml file.



Here is a short execution video of the project.
